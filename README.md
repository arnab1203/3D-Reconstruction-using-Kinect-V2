# 3D-Reconstruction-using-Kinect-V2
#### The objective of the project is to perform 3D reconstruction from depth and RGB images using a pair of Kinect V2 camera.

### Description
We assume that a set of image correspondences are given where these correspondences arrives from a unknown set of 3D points. Likewise the cameras calibration, orientation and position are also unknown. The primary task of such problem is to solve reconstruction problem by finding the camera matrices and 3D points to finally reconstruct from depth and RGB images.

<br>

### Camera Calibration
The calibration is done using checkborad calibration technique to calibrate both RBG camera and compute the extrinsic and intrinsic paramters of the camera.
