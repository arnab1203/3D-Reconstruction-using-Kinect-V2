#### Image segmentation to obtain the pattern of the image which is captured low-resolution and intially printed on aluminium foil

<br>
<br>

### Description
Implementation of SLIC proposed in (IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence) for segmenting and detecting the pattern:<br>
<br>

### When to use this algorithm?
Any segmentation problem based on detecting objects, for cutting out images and for reducing the amount of data to be processed.<br>
